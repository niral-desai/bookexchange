										<p>
										A bunch of graduate students striving to do something in such a way that
										can be really helpful to someone and that can alter the life as we know it.
										Online Book Exchange is our first step to do something for students like us.
										In case of text books, every time when any student wants to buy a book their first
										thought would be why not first look at library?
										if not, Second thought would be why shouldn't we opt for 'used books
										if there is same content in new book, and due to lack of availability of used books,
										we end up buying new books, making it heavy on our pocket.
										Readers who love to read novels and magazines, they have to pay for private library subscriptions
										or they have to buy new book which is very costly.
										</p>

										<p>
										Thus, We come into picture. We sell. We Buy. We Rent. We Exchange.
										</p>

										<p>
										We thought that how can we make things easy for students.
										So, We provide a platform for students to sell their used books online at
										reasonable prices rather then getting lump sum amount when they return their book to any shop,
										similarly a particular user can buy a book at reasonable price from some different user in his/her city/institute.
										</p>

										<p>
										For bookworms, we provide a service by which they can exchange their books/magazines and explore their knowledge.
										No need to pay for any books they want. We provide a list of books user wants to exchange
										and get another book in return.Hence, building a reading community.
										</p>
										<p>
										As a great reader once said, " We want to know that we're not alone."
