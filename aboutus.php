										<p>
										Nowadays, with the rise of digital technology physical books are now being available online. But the fun of reading comes only when you own it and it becomes a part of yours. We decided to make the sharing of books among bibliophiles very possible and convenient. “BOOK BOX” as the name suggests a collection of book readers and owners in a box.

										Our motive is to help the propensity for perusing and spread the word for all to enter the enchanted universe of books. As books constrain you to back off and see the world through the eyes of your brain.

										
										</p>

										<p>
										Thus, We come into picture. We sell. We Buy. We Rent. We Exchange.
										</p>

										<p>
										We thought that how can we make things easy for students.
										As new books are costly and full price for a book that we are going to use for a couple of months is not an ideal deal.
										So, We provide a platform for students to sell their used books online at
										reasonable prices rather then getting lump sum amount when they return their book to any shop,
										similarly a particular user can buy a book at reasonable price from some different user in his/her city/institute.
										</p>

										<p>
										For bookworms, we provide a service by which they can exchange their books/magazines and explore their knowledge.
										No need to pay for any books they want. We provide a list of books user wants to exchange
										and get another book in return.Hence, building a reading community.
										</p>
										<p>
										As a great reader once said, " We want to know that we're not alone."
